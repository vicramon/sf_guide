# How to Move to San Francisco

Alright, you finally got the job you’ve been dreaming of, and now it’s time to pack your bags and move to San Francisco! Or perhaps you’re going to try your luck once you get here. Either way, moving to SF can be a challenge. Having just made the move myself all the way from the other coast, I have a few tips for fellow SF newcomers that might come in handy. 

## Getting Your Stuff Here

DIY Options

**U-Haul**
As far as moving options go, the cheapest seems to be renting a U-Haul trailer and driving it yourself. If your car doesn’t have a trailer hitch, they’ll install one for you for about $260. If you don’t want to put the miles on your car you can rent an actual U-Haul truck and a car-trailer, then put your car on the car-trailer, thought that’s significantly more expensive.

**Auto Shipping**

If you don’t feel like driving, you can throw your stuff in your car, ship your car, then fly to meet your car. Depending on how far your car has to go, auto shipping can cost anywhere from $700 to a little over $1,000.

Every transport company will tell you not to put over 100 pounds of extra stuff in your car… but you can do it anyway. You might have to tip your driver though. 

**Full Service Options**

There are of course full-service moving companies that will manage your whole move for you. They’re just going to cost quite a bit more. PODS is another one that I’ve heard is good. 

## Storing Your Stuff While You Look For a Place

**DIY** 

U-Haul has a storage deal they’ll do for you if you use one of their services.

You can always rent a unit at a Public Storage facility for about $150/month, depending on the size. There are multiple Public Storage facilities in San Francisco. You should move your stuff from car toa storage unit quickly, because car break-ins are a thing to be concerned about in SF, especially if people can see stuff in you car.

**Full Service**

Many full-service moving companies have some integrated storage solution.

## Finding a Temporary Place to Stay

You should use Google Hotel Finder and sort by price and try to stay in the city. Traffic starts up at about 2pm every day, so the less distance you have to drive the better. If you have a car, make sure your search includes the amenity of “free parking”. You can usually get something that’s about $130/night. The cheaper the place, the more time you’ll have to look for a permanent residence. I think you should give yourself at least 14 days (part-time) to find a place, but likely longer. In the worst case it could take 4 weeks, depending on how picky you are.

## Finding an Apartment

Ok, you’ve made it to the city, your stuff is stored somewhere, now it's time to find an apartment. 

Studios in the city start at around $2,000, and 1 bedrooms are now $2,500 and up. You might find places cheaper in the Tenderloin area, but you should try not to live there as it’s a very rough neighborhood.

If you don't have a partner, then you'll probably want to decide between renting a studio and renting a bedroom in a shared apartment. It depends on how much you want to spend, and how much you like/dislike having roommates. A studio or 1 bedroom all to yourself will be more expensive but of course more convenient. 

Craigslist is the best way to search for places in SF. Visit http://sfbay.craigslist.org. If you want to find a bedroom in a shared apartment, make sure to choose “rooms/shared”. If you want your own place, clhoose “apts/housing”.

## Become The Chosen One

Now you’ve found a few listings you like, you need to send out an email to each of these people. 

If you're looking for a shared place, you'll want to include some info about yourself and a link to your LinkedIn and other public profiles so people know that you are who you say you are. I wrote one main template email, but I read each listing and modified it as necessary.

If you're looking for your own place, you don't need to say much about yourself, just that you'd like to see the place. 

I found that most people got back to me within 12 - 24 hours, and I was able to see most places the same week.

After seeing a bunch of places and disliking most of them because they had too much traffic noise, I got invited to live in a fairly quiet shared house in the Duboce Triangle. I’m very happy with my place and I really like my roommates.

## The Bureaucracy 

You’ll need to do a few annoying things when you get here:

1. Get a California drivers license. 
Be aware that the San Francisco DMV requires an appointment to get a first-time California driver’s license. They want you to get a license within 20 days, but most appointments are 1 month out. There’s a hack though: register for an appointment on the website early Tuesday morning, around 9-10am, and you’ll get an earlier appointment. I believe the system was designed this way specifically to handle this case (they told me this when I called). Currently you only need your Passport and other driver’s license to get a California Driver’s license.

2. If You Have a Car, Register your Car Here
Before you can register your car here you need to get it smog-checked. Certain smog-checking facilities allow for a free-re-test if your car fails. I found this one place [Golden Gate Auto Service](http://www.ggsmog.com/), it is one of the cheapest around at $32, and they offer a free re-test in case of failure. These guys were quick and courteous, so I recommend them. Once you have your smog-check certificate you can take your car to the DMV to get it registered. You do not need an appointment for this. One more thing: never go to the DMV on Monday morning. There will be a line out the door. 

3. If You Have a Car, Get a Parking Permit
Once you figure out where you’re going to live, you’ll likely need a parking permit to park in that area for more than 2 hours between 9am and 6pm. If you drive your car to work everyday then that’s not an issue, but otherwise you’ll get fined if you leave it without a permit. An organization called the SFMTA issues permits. You can read more about the requirements here: http://www.sfmta.com/services/permits-citations/parking-permits/residential-area-permits . Basically you just need your car registered at your address and insurance for your car at your address. Oh, and $100. The SFMTA office is on Van Ness towards downtown, and they’re pretty quick, as long as you don’t go on Monday morning.

## The Skinny on Public Transit

Caltrain, Muni and Bart are the public transit systems here. 
* Bart is always underground
* Muni is underground in some places and on streets elsewhere
* Caltrain is above ground on tracks, it goes from SF south all the way to Santa Clara. 

If you live in the city it can be very difficult to find parking in the evening. If you’re not going to use Bart or Muni, and the parking annoys you, you can get a motorcycle or scooter. Parking is very easy on a motorcycle because you only need a few feet of concrete. Plus there is dedicated motorcycle parking throughout the city. There’s even an app called “Park the Bike” that shows you nearby motorcycle parking.  The downside is that it’s more dangerous than driving, of course.

Other solutions for using a car when you want without owning one are ZipCar and GetAround.

## Street Cleaning

If you drive, make sure to always check for signs where you park your vehicle. There is weekly street cleaning on most streets in SF, and if you forget to move your car you’ll get a $66 dollar ticket. It's a racket, and everyone gets bit by this at some point. 

For when you go on vacation there is a hack. There are certain areas of the city that don’t require a street parking permit, don’t have meters, and only have street cleaning twice a month. One area is Glen Park/Diamond Heights. Another is the Outer Sunset, which has the benefit of being along the N-line, so you can take the Muni to get to your car twice a month if need be. However, be warned that there is a 72-hour parking limit for any parking spot in the city. I’ve heard people rarely get ticketed or towed for this, but it can happen. I’ve read that if your car is going to get towed, it will have a notice on it for the next 72 hours. So theoretically you can park your car in any one spot for 143 hours and 59 minutes without getting ticketed or towed.
